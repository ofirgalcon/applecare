## AppleCare module

This module requires Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager API (AxM) credentials. For directions, see [Create an API account in Apple School Manager](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-school-manager/create-an-api-account-axm33189f66a/web). The directions are similar for ABM.

### Features

* Automatic client-side syncing every 10-14 days (randomized interval)
* Manual sync options (individual device or bulk)
* Real-time progress tracking on admin page
* Multi-organization support via machine group key or Munki ClientID prefixes
* Intelligent rate limiting with HTTP 429 handling
* Comprehensive device information (model, color, MAC addresses, etc.)

### Configuration

Add your AxM credentials to the `.env` file. Use [create_client_assertion.sh](https://github.com/bartreardon/macscripts/blob/master/AxM/create_client_assertion.sh) to generate the `APPLECARE_CLIENT_ASSERTION` string. For more details, read [Using the new API for Apple Business/School Manager](https://bartreardon.github.io/2025/06/11/using-the-new-api-for-apple-business-school-manager.html).

**Single Organization:**

```bash
# API URL - Choose based on your organization type:
# Apple School Manager: https://api-school.apple.com/v1/
# Apple Business Manager: https://api-business.apple.com/v1/
APPLECARE_API_URL=https://api-school.apple.com/v1/
APPLECARE_CLIENT_ASSERTION="Your Assertion String"
APPLECARE_RATE_LIMIT=20  # Optional, default is 20 calls per minute
```

**Multiple Organizations:**

The module supports multiple organizations by matching either the machine group key prefix or the Munki ClientID prefix (before first hyphen) with org-specific environment variables. This allows different devices to use different Apple Business/School Manager accounts.

**How it works:**
The module uses a priority-based lookup system:

1. **First Priority: Machine Group Key** - Looks up the machine group key from `munkireportinfo.passphrase` for the device
   - Extracts the prefix before the first hyphen (e.g., `6F730D13-451108-AC457…` → `6F730D13`)
   - Looks for org-specific env vars: `6F730D13_APPLECARE_API_URL` and `6F730D13_APPLECARE_CLIENT_ASSERTION`
   - If machine group key exists but config vars are empty, falls back to ClientID

2. **Second Priority: Munki ClientID** - If machine group key not found or config vars empty:
   - Looks up the Munki `ClientIdentifier` for the device
   - Extracts the prefix before the first hyphen (e.g., `org1-device` → `ORG1`)
   - Looks for org-specific env vars: `ORG1_APPLECARE_API_URL` and `ORG1_APPLECARE_CLIENT_ASSERTION`

3. **Third Priority: Default Config** - Falls back to `APPLECARE_API_URL` and `APPLECARE_CLIENT_ASSERTION` if org-specific config is not found

**Example:**

**Using Machine Group Key:**
If a device has machine group key `6F730D13-451108-AC457…` in `munkireportinfo.passphrase`:
```bash
# Organization 1 (using machine group key prefix)
6F730D13_APPLECARE_API_URL=https://api-school.apple.com/v1/
6F730D13_APPLECARE_CLIENT_ASSERTION="Org1 Assertion"
```

**Using Munki ClientID:**
If a device has Munki ClientID `org1-device123`:
```bash
# Organization 1 (using ClientID prefix)
ORG1_APPLECARE_API_URL=https://api-school.apple.com/v1/
ORG1_APPLECARE_CLIENT_ASSERTION="Org1 Assertion"
```

**Complete Example with Fallback:**
```bash
# Default (fallback)
APPLECARE_API_URL=https://api-school.apple.com/v1/
APPLECARE_CLIENT_ASSERTION="Default Assertion"

# Organization 1 (machine group key prefix)
6F730D13_APPLECARE_API_URL=https://api-school.apple.com/v1/
6F730D13_APPLECARE_CLIENT_ASSERTION="Org1 Assertion"

# Organization 2 (ClientID prefix)
ORG2_APPLECARE_API_URL=https://api-business.apple.com/v1/
ORG2_APPLECARE_CLIENT_ASSERTION="Org2 Assertion"
```

**Notes:**
* Prefix matching is case-insensitive (e.g., `org1`, `ORG1`, `Org1` all match `ORG1_*` env vars)
* Machine group key is stored in `munkireportinfo.passphrase` column
* If a device's key/ClientID doesn't have a hyphen, the entire value is used as the prefix
* Tokens are cached per organization to avoid regenerating them for each device
* Machine group key matching takes precedence over ClientID matching

Add `applecare` to the `Modules` section in your `.env` file.

**Optional: Reseller Name Mapping**

The module can translate reseller IDs (from `purchase_source_id`) to readable names using a YAML configuration file. Create `local/module_configs/applecare_resellers.yml`:

```yaml
# Maps purchase_source_id values to readable reseller names
1A2B3C: 'Reseller Company Name'
4D5E6F: 'Another Reseller Inc'
789ABC: 'Example Reseller'
DEF123: 'Apple Retail Business'
# Add more reseller mappings as needed
```

When configured, reseller names will be displayed instead of IDs in the AppleCare tab and listings. Matching is case-insensitive.

### Syncing

**Automatic Syncing (Recommended):**

Clients automatically sync their AppleCare data every 10-14 days (randomized) during normal MunkiReport check-ins. The client script (`applecare.sh`) is automatically installed when the module is installed. No manual intervention is required.

**How it works:**
1. Client script runs during MunkiReport preflight
2. Maintains a plist file with `next_sync_timestamp` value
3. When timestamp elapses, script updates plist (triggers check-in)
4. Server processor detects updated plist and triggers sync
5. Script sets new random timestamp (10-14 days in future)

**Manual Syncing Options:**

1. **Individual Device**: Navigate to client detail page → AppleCare tab → Click "Sync Now" button. Syncs only that device and takes a few seconds.

2. **Bulk via Admin Page**: Navigate to Admin → Update AppleCare data → Click "Run AppleCare Sync". Shows real-time progress bar with device counts and sync output. **Note:** Large syncs (100+ devices) may timeout due to PHP execution limits. Use CLI script for large syncs.

3. **Bulk via CLI Script**: Run `php sync_applecare.php` from command line. Recommended for large syncs or scheduled automation. Can be scheduled with cron or other task schedulers.

### Admin Page Features

The AppleCare admin page (`Admin` → `Update AppleCare data`) includes:

* **System Status Panel**: API URL and Client Assertion configuration status, rate limit setting, masked API URL display
* **Sync Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar, device counts, color-coded sync output (green: success, yellow: warnings, red: errors), completion summary
* **Rate Limiting**: 1-second delay between fetches, automatic HTTP 429 handling with `Retry-After` support, configurable via `APPLECARE_RATE_LIMIT`

### Client Detail Page Features

* **AppleCare Tab**: Displays coverage records and device information, "Sync Now" button, "Last fetched" timestamp, links to listings/reports
* **Detail Widgets**: AppleCare Detail Widget (coverage summary) and AppleCare Total Widget (fleet statistics with filtered listing links)

### Troubleshooting

**Sync not triggering automatically:**
* Verify the client script is installed: Check for `/usr/local/munkireport/preflight.d/applecare`
* Check client logs for "Running applecare" and "Requesting applecare" messages
* Verify the plist exists: `/usr/local/munkireport/preflight.d/cache/applecare.plist`

**HTTP 40x errors during sync:**
* Verify API credentials are correct
* Check that the serial number exists in Apple Business/School Manager
* Review server error logs for detailed error messages

**Rate limit issues:**
* Increase `APPLECARE_RATE_LIMIT` if you have a higher API quota
* Run bulk syncs during off-hours
* Use the CLI script for large syncs to avoid PHP timeout limits

**Sync progress not updating:**
* Ensure you keep the admin page open during sync (closing the page stops the sync)
* For large syncs, use the CLI script instead of the web interface
